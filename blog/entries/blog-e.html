<p style="column-count: 2;">This week our class time was mostly dedicated to individual work time which was very grateful for because i sometimes find time management difficult especially with school work. Im not going to lie though, I am not using this time as efficiently as I should be so I have some catching up to do. Also id really like to thank you guys for extending the due date for this first project because I was a little worried about my performance. <br> <br>
This week Delena did some workshops on some of my class mate’s websites and after seeing that I think im going to re-work my ideal layout again to simplify it and make sure im not biting off more than I can chew. <br> <br>
Mental check in time haha, last week was good for me! Ive been so good to my mental and physical health this past week which is really exciting for me. I wrote a much less emo poem for my class and have been meditating, eating well, exercising more and i deleted social media for the week. Although the internet is a very fun and extremely useful tool for society it can also be incredibly distracting and draining. I ended up redownloading it again though because it keeps me feeling connected in these covid times lol. This week im going to make it a goal to wake up earlier and not skip meals. <br><br> </p>
<p> And here is my poem: <br><br>
Breath begins to fill my lungs and my brain feels clearer now. <br>
I’m starting to really care for my own being <br>
Instead of being wrapped up in how charming you are when you look at me. <br>
Now I look at myself and see through you. <br>
Beautiful. <br>
<br><br>
Not in appearance, <br>
but in the way a blue sky is beautiful. <br>
You are clouds, <br>
Grey and White hide the bright blue sky from view. <br>
Baffling, but it is always there, even when I am blinded. <br>
There the way oxygen is always there to fill my body with calm,  <br>
and presence. <br>
<br> <br>
It is beautiful to me, <br>
That although you view me as silly  <br>
I see the sincere effort, <br>
And smile still. <br>

I know your porcelain shines through only for the moment <br>
The sky is grey <br>
Still, I gladly open my blinds to get a glance of you. <br>
<br> <br>
How silly of me,
to fall under the impression that your smile and sparkling brown eyes see into me  <br>
and past yourself, <br>
a cloud. <br>

Some days I sulk in skies of white. <br>
Staring at sheets of Strato-form <br>
Thinking of your face <br>
Looking forward to the day that my favorite color peeks through again <br>
To appreciate the bright blue behind you <br>
And the sun. <br>
<br> <br>
And I stare. <br>
And stare. <br>
And stare, while I still can. <br>
<br> <br>
You ought to be thanking me. <br>
But I will thank you instead, <br>
Thank you clouds. <br>
<br>
I am starting to see the sun <br>
And the blue behind you, for more than a moment. <br>
And I smile. <br>
