        Hello! This last week has been chaotic for sure. I really enjoyed seeing everyone’s final project it was inspiring but also daunting because my work has not been to their level througout the semester. I have been working on my exercise 4 and I’ve been learning more about coding. I am worried about the results of my final project 2 because I decided to change m project from my proposal. I plan on redesigning my homepage instead of my exercise 4. I will link my new proposal to my final project 2 page. <Br>
            Additionally, I wanted to leave you with a poem I wrote.
            <Br><Br> It is Spring, the beginning of April and a friend and I went on a walk today. At the beginning of our trip, she places her airpod in my right ear. Only the two of us can hear this song right now, and my heart feels full. <Br>
            <br>
            We are walking outside - the sky is cloudy, and it smells like it may rain. Now It feels cruel, rolling quickly down my arms, and I know she just stepped in that puddle. <Br><Br>
            My clothing hangs tight to my skin, stickily saturated in rainwater. Her face is running in it too but her smile has not been washed away. My socks are wet but at the same time, water hugs the roots of starved life buried beneath the soil. <Br><Br>
            Although we moan about the way Mother Nature seems to have punished us, finally we all are nourished and full. <Br><Br>
            I look down to find my feet sprinting to the nearest shade to hide under. We are both dripping, tacky and blue, but left in love to have these leaves for shade and for each other. <Br><Br>
            Dewily we watch from a distance, the ecosystem smile from something outwardly cold, grey, and lonely. Buds and flowers dance and bloom. The two of us are left with the muggy trace of spring in our noses, soft conversations between birds in our heads, and the radiation of lushness from hydrated trees on our faces. <Br><Br>
            After the water has gone stillness is let in the air between us. My eyes peer into hers and around us to internalize the divine aftermath of this act, the rain has stopped, and the streets are soft. <Br>
