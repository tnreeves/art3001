        What do I want to do when I grow up? The first job I ever dreamed of having was a veterinarian when I was younger, probably until I was ten years old. Then I remember wanting to be a neurosurgeon, “neuro chemist”, an art curator, an architect, to work in real estate, and when I declared undecided is my major in college. Most recently I’ve been planning on confirming communications as my major, with a real estate and a studio art minor. I am only a sophomore so I should have “plenty of time” but I want to feel headstrong enough to pick something and go for it. A big fear for myself that I have Is stagnancy. I want to make something for myself and my family because they were immigrants here. It’s a lot of weight that I don’t think my friends can relate to a lot of the time. I’m a first gen for family on my mom’s side and my dad’s. They are very proud of me for getting so far in my education, but I still worry sometimes that I am not doing enough for myself. Living life and taking care of responsibilities on the daily sometimes feels like too much on my plate. I don’t want to complain though because I know plenty of people can relate to my struggles. There don’t seem to be enough hours in the day or enough energy in my being to carry through with all of the dreams in my head and enjoy the moment at the same time. <br>
        I’m thinking about how our little group of generations idolize celebrities. I don’t understand how people can work to the point where they are so successful, they don’t have to worry about taking their own garbage out, stressing over prepping their own meals, doing their own laundry, washing their own dishes etc. I think the difference between celebrities and myself is the actual act of following through with dreams. I find myself afraid to fail or waste my time, so I don’t even try. I have been thinking that that act is the commonality that keeps some families like mine poor and in a cycle of underperforming. How sad, but the great thing is I have the opportunity to change that. Its great! But also a lot of weight as I said earlier but I still have plenty of life to live and figure it all out.
