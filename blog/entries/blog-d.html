        This week in class we focused on using CSS on our websites which I’m excited about and have gotten to mess around with a bit but I’m definitely looking forward to doing more with it and figuring out more custom codes to personalize my site. <br> <br>
        I also helped lead the discussion on identity online where we talked about surveillance, censorship and how it effects black women specifically, I had a lot of fun with this presentation and it made me think deeply about how we view people and celebrities through social media. <br> <br>
        My classmates and I created drafts for our first project, which essentially is the appearance of our websites. I really enjoyed looking at what other people had planned and thinking about what I want to do with my own. I’m very intimidated by this project though because so far I haven’t been able to give as much attention as I would hope to this class and I’m worried my website will look dinky in comparison to my classmates. <br> <br>
        My anxiety levels have been thorough the roof lately and the biology class I’m in is not making coping with that any easier lol. I’m in a poetry writing class though and I’ve been really enjoying and appreciative of being give the time to write and get some of my frustrations or anxieties out that way. Funny note though, I shared the first poem I’ve ever written with my class and they basically psycho analyzed it and recommended I seek professional help with a therapist lol. Great times. Ill share my poem bellow but know ill be changing it a bit:
        <br> <br>
        Hills and Valleys <br> <br>
        Felt alone this morning <br>
        so, I pick up my pencil to try to fill the page and empty my brain <br>
        Hills and valleys! <br>
        Scared of rolling from the top it feels most comfortable in my valley, <br>
        start the climbing again kiddo <br>
        feels like a stupid, never ending cycle I didn’t even ask to be a part of. <br>
        Never would have of swam so far if I knew it’d be like this ha-ha <br>
        sigh <br>
        The sun will rise, it shines even when all I see are clouds. <br>
        I don’t know what I’m going to say, but I hope it brings us a little Hope. Bliss. Emotion. <br>
        I feel safe when it’s just us. <br>
        Even when we’re clearly not… fucking lonely. <br>
        It’s personal <br>
        Even if you could understand, I don’t want to share our thing with you. <br>
        It won’t mean as much to you… you’ll even think you already know. <br>
        All the shit that I have had to step in to get to this point. <br>
        I’m afraid my socks reek and I don’t want you to be the one to tell us. <br>
        Pretty sure I already know lol <br>
        Call me a peach, I’ve got a pit in my stomach <br>
         But it’s no big deal <br>
        feeling alone tonight, again. <br>
