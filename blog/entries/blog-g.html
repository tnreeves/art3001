    <h1>T-Dog's Weekly: G</h1>

        This week we shared our first projects and had a presentation on cyborg technology and AI. We touched on how prerecorded audio (like telemarketers or service voice mail) is becoming more human like. Companies do this by adding laughter and believably human like intonations in the AI’s voice. We talked about how it is preferable to have a human connection when getting help through online services when we need assistance with a complex situation. I do notice though that it is easier on my anxiety when I know I will be being aided through an automated system and not have to worry about getting my words together for a conversation with a real person. <br> <br>
        I’m not really satisfied with what I turned in for the first project but it took so much of my time and brain power so I’m proud of it nonetheless. I’m going to hopefully continue to work on it over the semester, add links, easter eggs and more design and photos to personalize the space and make it more interactive. <br>
        We were introduced tor the next project and I’m really thankful that we get the choice to either do project four or project five, it will take a lot of stress away from the process of learning new tricks and techniques for this class and website building/coding. I’m looking forward to learning new techniques and implementing them into my website. I want to specifically look into using a grid for designing. <br><br>
        Okay now its everyone’s favorite time of the weekly – mental check in time! I had a very tiring week but I’ve been getting up early so I have more time to take care of all of the little things. The weather is getting nice, not super warm but much less cloudy. It makes me really happy to see the blue sky, today I went out to the oval and people watched, a great time I definitely recommend. I am working on my next poem as well so ill have that at the end of this :-) Any who, I hope you’re doing well and taking care of yourself and checking in on the people you love! <br><br>

        Today I’ll throw on my White A1s with the blue monarch butterflies printed on them <br>
        The other day, I wore a sweatshirt that made me look like an orange. <br>
        <br><br>
        I walked to K-Comm to pick up my morning avocado toast <br>
        I couldn’t help but look at how other people expressed themselves that day. <br>
        <br><br>
        Some paint their eyelids in rich shades of red, <br>
        In deeper hues than the piercing firetruck-red my friend coats her toe-nails in. <br>
        <br><br>
        It’s animalistic, <br>
        The way that humans represent themselves. <br>
        Doing the absolute most.  <br>
        We may as well be designed with vibrant patterns. <br>
        <br><br>
        A feeling of inferiority, <br>
        Is a peacock above us? <br>
        <br><br>
        We are sold our clout, <br>
        Yet any bird is born in unique feathers. <br>
        <br><br>
        Human expression is about assimilating materials to our bodies <br>
        Doing our nails, dying our hair, makeup, shoes, clothes, jewelry, etc. <br>
        <br><br>
        Until we feel enough. <br>
        An embodiment of the soul. <br>
