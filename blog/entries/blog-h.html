    <h3>Hey there. <br>
        I really don’t know what to write about this week. I’m currently siting and eating some lunch, a cheese  quesadilla, Fritos and a coke. Yikes, now that I write that I’m lowkey kind of appalled. I’m wondering how many people are following the life style where all the food they consume is packaged. As a society we’ve gotten to the point where we don’t have to labor for our food. So we are probably a lot less grateful and have unhealthy eating patterns. I obviously really appreciate having this leisure and its great that we’ve gotten to this point. However, I really have no idea what I’m eating unless it is a fruit or vegetable. But even a that level there are nameless chemicals involved in the process because of commercialism. 
        <Br>
        I love cooking, adding spice and variations in ingredients to excite my taste buds. However, most of the food I eat is “eh”. I do have a disordered relationship with food so my opinion may be biased when I say food is gross. I recently heard that India has a system of getting home cooked meals to workers as their schedules become hectic and they often cant find time to cook. I bet those workers are much happier people than any college student living off of campus/fast food. 
        <br>
        The solution to my problem would be to cook more meals at home. But why spend money at Kroger when I can spend swipes at the union, ya know? 
        <br><br>
        Also, why don’t we feed our pet more nutritious and tasty food. Commercialism should not be as involve with our eating habits. Computers cants taste so why should they be the chefs for the country.

        I don’t have a poem for this week sorry  :(
