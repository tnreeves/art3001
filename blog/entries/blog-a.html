    <p>this was a fun week in class. we started putting our websites together, learning how to use different programs like github and visual studio code, very fun stuff (no sarcasm lol). outside of class i've been dealing with alot of family stress so jugling that with school work has been sort of anxiety inducing haha, but nothing i cant handle.  </p>
