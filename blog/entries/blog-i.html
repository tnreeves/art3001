        Hello! I hope you are doing well and you are getting to enjoy the Ohio spring weather. This is my favorite time of year. I love being able to watch society and nature come back to life. Trees are still bare at this point but the grass is getting greener, I think I’ve even seen a few flowers recently. One thing I’ve especially been enjoying taking walks to mirror lake, a lake on our campus. I like to sit there and watch the birds. I think the ducks are my favorute because they quack at eachother and dive under the water. So cute. I am so happy to be able to do my homework and sit outside at the same time. <br> <br>
        On a bit of a more introspective and maybe even sad note, I am feeling a little low today and been comparing myself a lot. I normally feel content with who I am but concumerism, sexism and racism has been weighing heavy on my mind recently. I find myself wanting more material things to make me feel as if im expessing my self truluy and fully. Like I want new shoes, bags, clothes, and accessories to feel pretty(?). I know it is a common human experience but it feels weird to want more than I have because I am happy with life as it is. Mmm sounds like im in denial and im actually unhappy. Glad I got that figured out, lol. Im going on a tangent so lets talk about school. <br> <br>
        This is getting crazy, im never taking 17 credit hours ever again.
