    <p>Hey! Last week in class we dedicated the time to working on our first project. We also had a couple of days off of our academic calendar which helped me a lot personally because (if you couldn’t tell by my previous blog entries) I have been a little stressed out so the two days without the stress of school hovering above me was extremely calming and much needed. I hope your mini break was as you needed as well. I spend the past few days working only on this class’s first project and trying to learn more about css and javascript but it feels like I’m getting nothing done after putting hours upon hours into my website. I cleaned up my code and I do have a much more solid understanding of basic html and css but I am still struggling with java script. But we will get there! I’m excited to continue my work today and tomorrow and see what my class mates have completed as well. I had to change up my plans for this project though, so I hope I don’t get any repercussions for not following my original plan.

        On another note, the weather is getting so so so nice outside and it is bringing me so much joy. Being able to sit outside and only be a little cold (opposed to being freezing) and there being fewer grey clouds in the sky makes me so happy. I also noticed that when the temperatures get above 50 there are so many people taking time to spend outside. I hope you take a second to appreciate those days as well, I know when I do it makes me feel appreciative and just full of love honestly. I’m really looking forward to spring coming up in a few weeks! I missed flowers, trees and bright sunny days :-) . <br>
        Im excited to be able to ride my bike and long board around and go on hikes and long walks with friends. What are you excited about with the warm weather?
