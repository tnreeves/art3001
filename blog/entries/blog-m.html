        Hello Blog! I love being on campus, it’s a great productive and abundant space to live. I have plenty of food options, someone cleans my bathroom, I have my own room and I don’t have the surveillance of my dad at all times. So I’m feeling a little conflicted. Because I love it away from home, but at the same time I do feel exhausted from being at school for the past nine months or so. I’m extremely happy to be free of many academic responsibilities in the next few weeks. It is important that I make sure I’m ending the year strongly and I’m nervous I’ve let my grades slip recently. There has been a lot going on in society I feel like, but maybe its just me. After getting my vaccine I let my responsibilities fade because I was so overjoyed with the thought of this pandemic coming to a close. This week I will be attempting to reverse the effects its had on my grades. But it makes me feel really sad and frustrated because all I want to do is go outside and do things that are fun in the sun. I love to skate, bike and go on walks. Most of the day I spend sitting at my desk (as I am right now)  looking out my window at the sky, trees and people walking around. Also, I think my seasonal allergies might be worst when I’m inside ☹ so that sucks. <br>
On another note, I read a book for the first time in a bit. It was short, titled “Get more done in les time: productivity and motivation 101” its free in apple books and I enjoyed reading it. I finished in a few hours and its got me motivated to finish up this semester and transition into summer. I hope you are doing well and have a great day or night.
