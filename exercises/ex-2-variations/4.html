        A love letter to me. <br>
        This letter is truly and doubtlessly a letter to the only person who will be left when everyone else is gone. To the woman of my life. To my love, my life, my everything. To me.
        <br><br>
        Dear me,
        <br><br>
        You, the way you are, are perfect. You, with your little struggles you bear, with all the strength you carry so desperately around, finding a way to use it in your everyday life. You, with all your words stuck in your throat that you are so scared to say out loud – so you write them down.
        You, with your smart-***-mouth trying to make this world a better place. You, who has already realized that you must better yourself first to better others. You are all through perfect in your own way.
        And yes, times were tough back then, but you were tougher. You mastered to overcome your biggest fear – the fear to stand for what you want and to love yourself entirely.
        And even though, your selflove has improved so much over these past few years, you must learn a lot, you will have to endure a lot of pain and gain a lot of strength.
        Selflove is a lifetime process.
        <br><br>
        My wonderful, beautiful love,
        You carry mountains on your back and universes in your mind.
        And every single day you wake up you are a better version of yourself.
        Whatever you wish to do – do so! This is your life and you have to hold the upper hand in it. You have to be your own master.
        Yes, let life be taught by others. Watch them live, but never become someone else while observing.
        God did his best in making you special and unique – do not destroy his work of art in imitating.
        <br><br>
        Learn.
        Observe.
        Master.
        <br><br>
        Once you can rely on yourself, you are ready to change the world.
        The world is waiting for you to make it the place it deserves to be.
        A good place, a place with no fear, with no terror.
        A place people can feel secure and loved.
        Make this not only a vision but the reality.
        Do your best and whatever you have reached at the end of the day – you DID your best.
        You were great, and you could not have done any better.
        <br><br>
        I am proud of you. <br>
        And I love you.
        <br>
        <br>
        To the dearest, most beautiful person on this planet, me. <br>
